### Greetings!  üëã

#### I'm a Lead Software Developer @ [QED](https://www.qedcode.io/), Founder @ [Me≈°tar.hr](https://mestar.hr/)

Specializing in **`Laravel & Vue.js`**, but also familiar with **`React.js & React Native`**. <br /> 
I create beautiful and complex Websites, Applications, e-Commerce, SaaS products, Rest APIs, and more!

Additionally, I utilize:

- **`Filament`** - customized Admin panels for Laravel apps,
- **`PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis and/or MongoDB`** - database and state management,
- **`Tailwind (with Flowbite) and/or Bootstrap 5`** - UI, Layout, and Template scaffolding.
- `.php`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.html`, `.scss` - just a few of the ingredients in my daily cookbook.

By day, I build top-notch applications, and by night, I play chess!

Wanna play? ‚ôüÔ∏è Challenge me on [Chess.com](https://link.chess.com/play/jGYw2M)!
